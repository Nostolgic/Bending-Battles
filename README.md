Bending battle

Bending battle is a 3v3 online fighting game where benders fight to push each other’s out of an arena containing three layers -zones- the last team standing wins.

Health system:

Your health as a player would be represented as a hit-counter the more you get hit the lower the counter is when the counter reaches zero you get pushed out of zone and your counter goes back to max but is easier to go down this time (the lower the zone you are in the easier it is to push you out of it)

Ability/element system:

There are three elements to bend earth, fire, air and water each element will have an auto attack (left mouse click) which is unique among the elements ex: (if chose to be a fire bender you will get the fire bender auto attack).

For the abilities you will get to choose three abilities from a deck of cards

Every element will have a unique set of spell cards that the player will choose only three of them at the start of the game.

Benders can take cards form an element they can’t bend.

Every spell card will have its own cooldown and damage it will defer making the game balanced.
